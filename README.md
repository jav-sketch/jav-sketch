I have always had a passion for technology. Being an avid and curious learner - I got my first computer back in 2006. It was a Dell Inspiron, which came with the Windows XP operating system. From that point forward, I developed a taste for computers and technology.

What drove me to become a tech enthusiast? Being curious about how systems work, especially in the Information Technology field - helped in the realization that:
I can build and develop computer systems and web applications from scratch.
I can learn skills akin to programming and programming language concepts needed to develop software, etc.
Hone my skills in relational database designs.
Learn how to integrate payment gateways and deploy web applications to various hosting platforms(cloud, etc.).
I can contribute to open source projects as well as create some of my projects.
These are some of the reasons why I choose to pursue a career in Information Technology.
